It has very interesting drama that is unrealstic which makes it more good.
You just wish you had their lives because their problems are so interesting.
The show is based in New York which gives it a cool vibe and makes you just want to move to the upper east side.
The acting is so good unlike certain shows and overall I just highly suggest to watch this show.</p2></div>
